# Motivation_Challenge
This is the result of a team of four people working on a project. The data was from a motivation survey, and we aimed to answer two main questions based on the available data.

Questions

Question 1: Is it possible to group patients based on their similarity in answers? If so, how many groups would exist?

Question 2: Is it possible to group motivations? For example, do Collectors and Curiosity cluster together?
